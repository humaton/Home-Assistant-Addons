# Docker file to create an image for a hass.io add-on that contains enough software to listen to events via RTL_SDR/RTL_433 and then publish them to the Home Assistant REST API.
# The script resides in a volume and can be modified to meet your needs.
# This hass.io addon is based on Chris Kacerguis' project here: https://github.com/chriskacerguis/honeywell2mqtt,
# which is in turn based on Marco Verleun's rtl2mqtt image here: https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt

# IMPORTANT: The container needs privileged access to /dev/bus/usb on the host.
